Current Status âœ…
You've successfully implemented:

User authentication (register/login/logout)
JWT token management
Password hashing with bcrypt
User profile management
Basic user stats structure
Database integration (SQLite)

Still Need to Implement ðŸ”„
1. Tournament System Backend

Tournament creation and management endpoints
Tournament registration system
Matchmaking logic
Tournament bracket generation
Tournament state management (ongoing, completed)
Tournament results tracking

2. Game Session Management

Game state tracking
Score recording and validation
Match history storage
Real-time game updates (if implementing multiplayer)
Game result persistence

3. Enhanced User Stats System
javascript// You'll need to expand your current stats to include:
- Tournament wins/losses
- Individual game statistics
- Win/loss ratios
- Performance metrics
- Historical data
4. Friend System (from User Management module)

Add/remove friends endpoints
Friend request system
Online status tracking
Friend list management

5. Security Enhancements

Input validation middleware
Rate limiting
HTTPS enforcement
SQL injection prevention
XSS protection

6. Database Schema Completion
You'll need additional tables for:

Tournaments
Tournament participants
Games/matches
Match results
Friend relationships

7. API Endpoints for Game Integration

Game initialization
Player movement validation
Score updates
Game state synchronization

8. Optional Advanced Features (based on chosen modules):

Live Chat System: Real-time messaging, user blocking
AI Integration: AI player management
Multiplayer Support: Multi-player game coordination
Blockchain Integration: Tournament score storage (if chosen)

Next Priority Steps:

Tournament System - Core requirement
Game Session Management - Essential for score tracking
Enhanced Database Schema - Support all features
Friend System - Part of user management module
Security Hardening - Critical for production

Would you like me to help you implement any of these specific components? I can provide detailed code examples for the tournament system or game session management to get you started.
